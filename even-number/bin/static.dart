// we can use the static wrd where we want t use the same peratin multiple time
// rather than writting the repatitative cde fr eg 
// if we want t calculate the price f any car in 
// car purchasing app and shw the user the n rad price 
// fr a car that has included all the tax and insurance 
// we can create a static methd r class where we can 
// write the lgic t calculat the price and use it in multiple place
// just like the exprt mdule in js r cmpnent in react and nextjs
